To display list of databases:
select * from pg_database;

To check if there are any pending restart for a parameter to take effect.
select name,source,boot_val,sourcefile,pending_restart from pg_settings where name='max_connections';
show max_connections;


To reload the configuration file:
select * from pg_reload_conf();

To View parameters from pg_file_settings. Need to read more.
select * from pg_file_settings;


 alter system reset all;
This will reset the contents of /var/lib/pgsql/12/data/postgresql.auto.conf

alter system set reset all;
alter system set work_mem='
select * from pg_file_settings where name='work_mem';


Identify the DB name:
SELECT current_database();
select version();

CREATE USER davide WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4';

Create tablespace:
mkdir -p /var/lib/pgsql/12/data/global/tempts ( pre-creation is mandatory)
create tablespace tempts location '/var/lib/pgsql/12/data/global/tempts';

#WARNING:  tablespace location should not be inside the data directory
#ERROR:  directory "/var/lib/pgsql/12/data/global/tempts" does not exist

mkdir -p /var/lib/pgsql/12/data_ts
postgres=# create tablespace tempts4 location '/var/lib/pgsql/12/data_ts';
CREATE TABLESPACE

Create database using utility createdb
createdb -D tempts4 -O tempuser -p 5432 -U postgres tempdb4
-D tempts4 is the new DB name

Auto Vaccum is enabled by default at table level. Auto Vaccum Deamon runs automatically after certain amount of transactions.
Disable:   alter table tel_directory set (autovaccum_enabled=false);
Verify auto vaccum status:   select reloptions from pg_class where relname='tel_directory';

Explain Plan:
explain select * from tel_directory;

Analyze:
analyze tel_directory;

Get table stat details:
select relname,reltuples,relpages from pg_class where rel_name='tel_directory';

Query Execution Cost:
Cost = number_of_pages * seq_page_cost + number_of_rows*cpu_tuple_cost

number_of_pages = select relpages from pg_class where relname='tel_directory';
show seq_page_cost # mostly 1 from postgresql.conf file
number_of_rows = select count(*) from tel_directory;
show cpu_tuple_cost ## approximately 0.01


Vaccum:
Plain Vacuum of table:
vaccum(verbose) tel_directory;

Full Vacuum:
vaccum(full,verbose) tel_directory;

To get the Frozen Transaction ID of a database.
select datname,age(datfrozenxid),current_setting('autovacuum_freeze_max_age') from pg_database order by 2 desc;
