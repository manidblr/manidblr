Create Tablespace:
=> CREATE TABLESPACE test_ts DATAFILE SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON MAXSIZE 10G;
=> alter tablespace test_ts default compress;
Creating Compressed tablespaces is allowed.

=> AWS RDS supports compression:
=> AWS RDS doesn't support tablespace encryption. select * from v$encryption doesn't show a wallet.

We cannot run OS commands from SQLplus. Max we can do is copy files from RDS server to S3 and viceversa using S3_INTEGRATION option.
Executing OS commands from SQLPLUS can be done using Scheduler Program of Program_Type EXECUTABLE. But, this needs "CREATE EXECUTABLE PROGRAM" privilege and granting this privilege is not allowed. 
DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_PROGRAM ( program_type=> 'EXECUTABLE',

Other Alternative is to Create a Java Program and execute OS programs. For this JVM option needs to be enabled. However, granting of permissions on executing java program that access OS is denied.
exec dbms_java.grant_permission( 'SCOTT', 'SYS:java.io.FilePermission','<>','execute');
