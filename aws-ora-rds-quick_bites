Create Tablespace:
=> CREATE TABLESPACE test_ts DATAFILE SIZE 1G AUTOEXTEND ON MAXSIZE 10G;
=> alter tablespace test_ts default compress;
Creating Compressed tablespaces is allowed.

=> AWS RDS supports compression:
=> AWS RDS doesn't support tablespace encryption. select * from v$encryption doesn't show a wallet. (Not 100% sure). Below grants are failing with permissions issue.
alter system set encryption key identified by "T45rustMe54";
CREATE TABLESPACE test_ts DATAFILE SIZE 10M AUTOEXTEND ON MAXSIZE 1G encryption using 'AES128' default storage (encrypt);


Database is created by default in NOARCHIVELOG mode. Convert to ARCHIVELOG as below.

ALTER database ARCHIVELOG;


We cannot run OS commands from SQLplus. Max we can do is copy files from RDS server to S3 and viceversa using S3_INTEGRATION option.
Executing OS commands from SQLPLUS can be done using Scheduler Program of Program_Type EXECUTABLE. But, this needs "CREATE EXECUTABLE PROGRAM" privilege and granting this privilege is not allowed. 
DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_PROGRAM ( program_type=> 'EXECUTABLE',

Other Alternative is to Create a Java Program and execute OS programs. For this JVM option needs to be enabled. However, granting of permissions on executing java program that access OS is denied.
exec dbms_java.grant_permission( 'SCOTT', 'SYS:java.io.FilePermission','<>','execute');

Using Oracle GoldenGate with Amazon RDS:
Oracle GoldenGate (GoldenGate) collects, replicates, and manages transactional data between databases. It is a log-based change data capture (CDC) and replication software package used with Oracle databases for online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. GoldenGate creates trail files that contain the most recent changed data from the source database and then pushes these files to the target database. Amazon RDS supports GoldenGate for Oracle Database Standard Edition Two (SE2) and Enterprise Edition (EE).
Created RCU in the past for OBI setup.


Using the Oracle Repository Creation Utility on Amazon RDS for Oracle
You can use Amazon RDS to host an Oracle DB instance that holds the schemas to support your Fusion Middleware components. Before you can use Fusion Middleware components, you must create and populate schemas for them in your database. You create and populate the schemas by using the Oracle Repository Creation Utility (RCU).


Installing a Siebel database on Oracle on Amazon RDS
You can use Amazon RDS to host a Siebel Database on an Oracle DB instance. The Siebel Database is part of the Siebel Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application architecture.
