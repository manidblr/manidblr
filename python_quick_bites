Add a help topic about your function.

def least_difference(a,b,c):
  """
  This function returns least absolute difference of three numbers

  r1 = abs(a-b)

The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call help() on a function, it shows the docstring.


Python allows us to define non-returning functions like print(), help() etc.. The result of calling them is the special value None.
Default argument values.
def print_hello(who="Ajay"):
    print("Hello my friend ",who)
    



Round with negative integer.
round(23.12345,-1) will round it to 20.0
round(123.12345,-2) will round it to 100.0


Evaluation precedence:
And is evaluated First. 

True or True and False

Strings:
datestr = '1956-01-31'
yyyy, mm, dd = datestr.split('-')
print(yyyy,mm,dd)
1956 01 31


"/".join([yyyy,mm,dd])
'1956/01/31'


Formatting a string(Python 3)
"{}, you will always be my {}th planet".format("Pluto",9)

planet="Pluto"
position=9
print("{}, you will always be my {}th planet".format(planet,position))


"{} weighs about {:.2} kilograms({:.3%} of Earths mass). It is home to {:,} plutonians".format(planet,pluto_mass, pluto_mass/earth_mass, plutonians)
'Pluto weighs about 1.3e+22 kilograms(0.218% of Earths mass). It is home to 52,910,390 plutonians'

# Referring to format() arguments by index, starting from 0
s = """
{0} is a planet.
{0} is not a {1}
!{0} Not planet
""".format('Pluto','Dwarf Planet')
print(s)

Empty string is considered as False

String Enumeration: Very important.
mylist = ['A', 'B' ,'C', 'D']
e_list = enumerate(mylist)
print(list(e_list))
Output:

[(0, 'A'), (1, 'B'), (2, 'C'), (3, 'D')]


Enumerate list objects.
doc_list = ["The Learn Python Challenge Casino.", "They bought a car", "Casinoville"]
keyword = "casino"
for i, doc in enumerate(doc_list):
    print("{} is {}".format(i,doc))
0 is The Learn Python Challenge Casino.
1 is They bought a car
2 is Casinoville
